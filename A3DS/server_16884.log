11:54:46 BattlEye Server: (Global) High Alert Highlander : one two important rules  u cant kill people inside the stores 
11:54:47 BattlEye Server: (Global) VunderFiz: also spawning with M4 with M855 seems kinda unfair right? cause that cartridge itself is OP 
11:54:53 BattlEye Server: (Global) High Alert Highlander : those r likesafe zones 
11:55:57 BattlEye Server: (Global) High Alert Highlander : and u cant use  jets  unles the seerver have at least  have population  that is 20people 
11:56:07 BattlEye Server: (Global) VunderFiz: cool 
11:56:09 BattlEye Server: (Global) VunderFiz: hate jets
11:56:12 BattlEye Server: (Global) High Alert Highlander : but if there is another jet flying 
11:56:21 BattlEye Server: (Global) High Alert Highlander : for doing mission only

11:57:18 BattlEye Server: (Global) VunderFiz: IHS just lest you do whatever
11:58:02 BattlEye Server: (Global) High Alert Highlander : that basically  helps the people to start making missions  or at least have the chance of defending themself from other players
11:58:30 BattlEye Server: (Global) VunderFiz: thats fair
11:58:40 BattlEye Server: (Global) VunderFiz: damn thunder being loud...
