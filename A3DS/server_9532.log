22:10:09 BattlEye Server: (Global) Rou Kowalski: Ya, get a caryall, put 2 HEAT missiles in it, 1 in the launcher.. and 3 more in your vehicle.. 
22:10:41 BattlEye Server: (Global) Rou Kowalski: you can clear the salt flats solo, and make a even mill per round
22:11:26 BattlEye Server: (Global) Rou Kowalski: hit the heavys low to sell them at the VS, hit the APC, in the center and salvage
22:13:46 BattlEye Server: (Global) Rou Kowalski: The m2010 will take out the runners with ease up to 1k, minor skill with drop after that
22:16:56 BattlEye Server: (Global) Rou Kowalski: 1k max range with the verona, its laser guided, so keep the cross hairs on the target
22:20:16 BattlEye Server: (Global) Rou Kowalski: 1 tank left where you killed the 2

22:26:51 BattlEye Server: (Global) Rou Kowalski: Cash all around MRAP
22:27:38 BattlEye Server: (Global) Rou Kowalski: That should buy you a great load out and a much more deserving vehicle than a red hatch
22:28:12 BattlEye Server: (Global) Rou Kowalski: Sell the drugs or use them for perks
22:29:38 BattlEye Server: (Global) Rou Kowalski: and for extra cash, you can load up the m16's into the vehicle, sell vehicle contents, then vehicle
