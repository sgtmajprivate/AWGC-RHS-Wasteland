10:56:42 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: i like the concept
10:57:24 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: i have been thinking using the civilian faction for the resistence
10:57:30 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: if you need any help testing or something, let me know
10:57:36 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: that ones in italiy 
10:57:48 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: defenetely 
10:57:54 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: yep, that would fit, but the would need access to german weapons then
10:58:10 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: yes alsorussian
10:58:21 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: because they would pick up anything from whoever they killed just to scavenge
10:58:31 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: the resistence eas formedby germans italians russiand 
10:58:59 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: sothey would have access to a couple of  all factions weapons
10:59:12 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: not all of them 
10:59:13 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: well depends on the underground you would use. french resistence would not necessarily have russon burp guns, but would have german mauser machine....
10:59:29 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: pistols, like thier 9mm submaching gun
10:59:30 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: exactly 
11:00:05 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: hand grenades, shit like that
11:00:08 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: missions will bve really hard

11:00:47 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: what is the map, area wise
11:00:57 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: the miliyary patrol would have 10 tanks total
11:01:05 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: with max crew oneach
11:01:39 BattlEye Server: (Group) ANATOLI CHEJOV: im still deciding that 
11:02:24 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: so i have built missions in dcs wwii era. and i would go to google and find out what the real units had and just built that samething
11:02:50 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: now mine was for fw-190's and br-109's.....
11:03:06 BattlEye Server: (Group) Merc: but i would resarc the units and see what they had and went off that
